The Job Posting Application provides recruiters with a seamless platform to post job listings for
public viewing and application. Recruiters can easily create accounts and post job opportunities, 
including details such as job title, salary, description, and required candidate experience.
These job listings are made available for all users to view and apply. Recruiters can manage 
their job listings and review applications directly through the application interface. With user-friendly screens for job posting and management, the application aims to simplify the
recruitment process for recruiters and provide a convenient platform for job seekers to explore and apply for opportunities.
